textfile.asm

This program takes an [inputfile] as its only argument and
generates a new file with a line number at the beginning
of each line of the input file.

How to use this program:
	- Execute from the command line: ./textfile [inputfile]
	- Enter the output filename
	- Press enter

This is a long line whose only purpose is test how the output will behave when it takes a line with length over the buffer size which is 100 (this line is 175 characters long)
